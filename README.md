# 💻 LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, starting in **C**.  
As I progress through my **BSc Computer Science degree**, I’ll add solutions in other languages I learn — like **Python**, **Java**, or even **C++**.

---

## 🧠 Goal

- Practice and improve problem-solving skills
- Learn how to write clean, efficient code
- Track my growth over time

---

## 📊 Problem Tracker (optional)

| # | Problem Name       | Language | Difficulty | Status    |
|---|--------------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Two Sum            | C        | Easy       | ✅ Solved |
| 2 | Reverse Linked List| C        | Easy       | 🚧 In Progress |

> 💡 You can update this list *only if you want to* keep track manually.

## 🔖 Notes

Each file contains:
- The problem number and name
- A link to the original problem on Leetcode
- My solution with comments if needed

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Some of the solutions in this repository may not follow the exact function signature or formatting required by LeetCode.  
This is intentional: I’m using these problems to practice **problem-solving and algorithm design** in my own way.  
I focus on writing full, testable programs independently, rather than copying and pasting into an online editor.

This approach helps me:
- Understand the logic deeply
- Learn to write complete programs from scratch
- Think outside the box

When I need to submit to platforms like LeetCode, I can always adjust the structure to match the required format.
